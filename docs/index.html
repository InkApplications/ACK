            <h1>Parser</h1>
            <p>
                The ACK Parser provides data structures and a multiplatform
                parsing utility for handling AFSK AX.25 Frames as well as
                String frames from APRS-IS.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong>
                The ACK Parser is still experimental.

        <h1>Q&A</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>What is an APRS-IS Passcode and where do I get one?</h2>
            <p>
                Internet Services for APRS (APRS-IS) requires a passcode in order
                to publish data to the service.
                This is only required if you intend to broadcast your location
                to the Internet APRS services, and is intended to control spam and
                limit the sevice to licensed radio operators.
            </p>
            <p>
                We <strong>do not assign these passcodes</strong> and they are
                generated from your license. There are different ways you can
                obtain these, it is up to you to obtain one properly for your
                license.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the advanced user, the command line tool for
                <a href="https://github.com/InkApplications/ACK">ACK</a>
                can also generate these for you.

            <h2>Will the Android application work offline?</h2>
            <p>Yes.</p>
            <p>This application was designed specifically with offline in mind.</p>
            <p>Internet specific features, such as APRS-IS will obviously not be available offline.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Does the Android application require Play Services?</h2>
            <p>No.</p>
            <p>
                I have gone out of my way to make sure that this application does
                not require Google's Play services and will function on nearly any
                Android device.
