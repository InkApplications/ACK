                The ACK CLI Client provides a jvm application for receiving
                data from APRS-IS, as well as file-parsing and other APRS
                utilities such as passcode generation.

            <h1>Android Application</h1>
            <p>
                The ACK Android Application provides APRS-IS and AFSK access
                to the APRS network as well detailed logs and maps.

        <h1>Q&A</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>What is an APRS-IS Passcode and where do I get one?</h2>
            <p>
                Internet Services for APRS (APRS-IS) requires a passcode in order
                to publish data to the service.
                This is only required if you intend to broadcast your location
                to the Internet APRS services, and is intended to control spam and
                limit the sevice to licensed radio operators.
            </p>
            <p>
                We <strong>do not assign these passcodes</strong> and they are
                generated from your license. There are different ways you can
                obtain these, it is up to you to obtain one properly for your
                license.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the advanced user, the command line tool for
                <a href="https://github.com/InkApplications/ACK">ACK</a>
                can also generate these for you.
            </p>

        <article>
            <h2>Is the App Free?</h2>
            <p>
                The ACK parsing and encoding library is free and open source.
                The android application that integrates these this library
                is sold on the Google Play store to support the ongoing
                development of both the app and the open source library.

            <h2>How can I Support Development</h2>
            <p>
                If you would like to support the developer directly, you
                can do so through
                <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ReneeVandervelde">Github Sponsors</a>

        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Will the Android application work offline?</h2>
            <p>Yes.</p>
            <p>This application was designed specifically with offline in mind.</p>
            <p>Internet specific features, such as APRS-IS will obviously not be available offline.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h2>Does the Android application require Play Services?</h2>
            <p>No.</p>
            <p>
                I have gone out of my way to make sure that this application does
                not require Google's Play services and will function on nearly any
                Android device.
            </p>

        <article>
            <h2>Is there an iOS App?</h2>
            <p>No.</p>
            <p>
                This would require a lot of additional work to support less
                compatible devices in a closed and unfriendly ecosystem.
                An iOS compatible application is not being considered at
                this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the core library supports Kotlin Multiplatform,
                much of which is compatible with Apple native targets.
